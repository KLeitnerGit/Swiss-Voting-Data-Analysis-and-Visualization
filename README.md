The data used for this purpose comes from the University of Bern. The
Ann√©e Politique Suisse, based there, maintains a comprehensive data set
(Swissvotes) on all votes that have taken place since the founding of
the modern federal state in 1848 (<https://swissvotes.ch/page/dataset>) to 2023. 

Since the data set is very large (834 variables), following variables are selected: 


-   **volkja-proz** : Percentage of yes-votes out of valid votes
-   **ja-lager**: Sum of the voter shares of all parties that recommended their voters to vote "Yes", the yes camp
-   **datum**: Date of the voting day
-   **title_kurz_d**: Short version of the official title of the vote in German
-   **title_kurz_en**: Short version of the official title of the vote in English
-   **swissvoteslink**: Link to the vote
