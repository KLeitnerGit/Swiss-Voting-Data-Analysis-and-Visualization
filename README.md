# Swiss-Voting-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-1848-2023


This project deeps into data from [Swissvotes.ch](https://swissvotes.ch/page/home) to provide a  analysis and visualization of extreme Swiss voting data from 1848 to 2023. Although the homepage is available in German, French, and English, not all data is accessible in English. This project aims to make this information readily accessible by highlighting the most significant Swiss votes over the years, categorizing them into the upper and lower quantiles. The analysis is presented in an interactive Plotly Dash graph, accompanied by a list that includes direct links to specific votes. Additionally, the results are available for download as a HTML file:  [Extreme Swiss votes over the years](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=14p4r9uy71Lk963vjmU-Skqf6KI3aDMFT)
